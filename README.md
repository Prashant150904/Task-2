IPL Match Insights – Power BI Dashboard
The project leverages Power BI to visualize and explore insights from IPL match data. Using the matches.csv dataset, I created an interactive dashboard that tells a compelling story through data.
 Key Insights:
- Certain cities hosted significantly more matches.
- Winning the toss doesn’t always guarantee winning the match.
- Some players have dominated as "Player of the Match".
- Toss decisions have shifted over seasons — more teams opt to field first.
- A few teams consistently outperform others across seasons.

2.Count of winner by team2 and team1
Compares wins by teams when they were listed as "team1" vs. "team2" in fixtures.

3.Count of venue by city
Lists the number of matches hosted in each city (e.g., Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata).

4.Count of winner by team1
Displays how often "team1" (the first team listed in a fixture) won matches.

5.City and venue
Maps specific stadiums (e.g., Barabati Stadium) to their respective cities.

6.Count of toss_winner by toss_decision
